# Aim of the Experiment - Write a program that implements the following sorting methods to sort a given list of integers in ascending order
i) Bubble sort ii) Selection sort iii) Insertion sort

##Definition:
Bubble Sort- Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.This sorting techniques happens thrugh passes.

###Step by step Procedure of the Experiment:
1)The Array to be sorted is declared and initialized.
2)The function bubble_sort is passed with one parameter namely the address of the Array.
3)The bubble_sort algorithm uses two for loops one within the other.
4)The outer for loop runs (n-1) times thus creaaates n-1 passes through the data.
5)The outer for loop runs from i = 1 to n(i.e.Size of the Array) and the inner for loop runs from j = i + 1 to n - 1. This process is repeated from start to end of the array.
6)Then in the loop,If a[j] is greater than a[i] then swap both the elements a[j] and a[i] using a temporary variable(i.e. t). Here ends both the loops. 
7)To print all the array's sorted elements, we use another For loop which runs from i = 1 to i = 10.
8)Hence the Bubble Sort program is executed successfully.
